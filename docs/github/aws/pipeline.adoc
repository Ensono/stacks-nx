== Pipeline

There are two pipelines at work within the repository. The one that is run by the CI/CD platform and ones that are executed by the Ensono Digital Independent Runner (EDIR).

NOTE: The Independent Runner is the main pipeline that is executed, whether it is by a CI/CD platform or on a local machine. The CI/CD pipelines are shims that call the Independent Runner which ensures that the pipeline is executed the same way each time.



=== Independent Runner

The EDIR has a number of pipelines that run a number of tasks.
